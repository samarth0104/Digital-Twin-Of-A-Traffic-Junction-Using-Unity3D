# Traffic Management System Using Unity3D
Traffic congestion is a prevalent issue in urban areas worldwide, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and environmental pollution. Effective traffic management systems are essential to alleviate congestion and ensure smooth traffic flow. This project proposes the development of a Traffic Management System (TMS) using the Unity game engine, aiming to simulate and optimize traffic flow in a virtual urban environment.
